Scalar Data Types
-----------------

- Integer
- Double
- Character, String
- Regular Expressions


== Integer

[quote, The Merriam Webster Dictionary]
Any of the natural numbers, the negatives of these numbers, or zero.

- Ranges
  * Signed: -(2^n-1^) to (2^n-1^ - 1)
  * Unsigned: 0 to (2^n^ - 1)

- Fast hexadecimal => binary conversions because log~2~(16) = 4

- Fast operations: Comparison, Negation, Addition, Multiplication

.int32_t examples, the prefix 0x denotes a hexadecimal value

|============================
| Real Value  | Memory Value
| 0x0		  | 0x0
| 0x1		  | 0x1
| -0x1		  | 0xFFFFFFFF
| -0x10	      | 0xFFFFFFF0
| -0x100	  | 0xFFFFFF00
| -0x1000	  | 0xFFFFF000
| -0x10000	  | 0xFFFF0000
| -0x100000	  | 0xFFF00000
| -0x1000000  | 0xFF000000
| -0x10000000 | 0xF0000000
| -0x80000000 | 0x80000000
|  0x7FFFFFFF | 0x7FFFFFFF
|============================

This representation mechanism is called *Two's Complement*. Sum of a positive number and
its negative counterpart gives 2^n^ (except zero, n is number of bits). The
conversion between negative and positive (multiplication with -1) can be done
very fast as bit negation (ones' complement) and increase by 1.


== Double

.IEEE-754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic
  Specifies interchange and arithmetic formats and methods for binary and decimal floating-point arithmetic in computer programming environments.
 IEEE = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

.Representation

There are some reserved values for signed zero, infinity, and NaN (not a number).
For non-reserved values, numeric representation can be obtained with the
following formula:

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    double a;
    double b;

    a = 1;
    b = a + 1;
    if(a == b) {
        printf("this would be weird\n");
    }

    a = 10000000000000000.0;
    b = a + 1;
    if(a == b) {
        printf("yes, this is perfectly normal\n");
    }
}

for detailed information.


== Character, String

A string is often implemented as an array of bytes that stores a
sequence of characters, using some character encoding.
String may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data
types and structures.

== Character Encoding

[source, csharp]
----
string name = "Antonín Dvořák";
//name.Length == 14
----

.Abbreviations
 UCS = Universal Coded Character Set; UTF = UCS Transformation Format


.UTF-8

UTF-8 encoded string occupies 17 bytes.

----
00000000: 41 6e 74 6f 6e c3 ad 6e 20 44 76 6f c5 99 c3 a1  Anton..n Dvo....
00000010: 6b                                               k
----

.UTF-32

UTF-32 encoded string occupies 56 bytes.

----
00000000: 00 00 00 41 00 00 00 6e 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 6f  ...A...n...t...o
00000010: 00 00 00 6e 00 00 00 ed 00 00 00 6e 00 00 00 20  ...n.......n... 
00000020: 00 00 00 44 00 00 00 76 00 00 00 6f 00 00 01 59  ...D...v...o...Y
00000030: 00 00 00 e1 00 00 00 6b                          .......k...
----

- UTF-32 uses fixed four bytes
- UTF-8 uses a byte at the minimum in encoding the characters
- UTF-8 encoded file tends to be smaller
- UTF-8 is compatible with ASCII

Consider problems like sorting, error detection, length determination, and
conversions between distinct encodings.


== Regular Expressions

A regular expression, regex or regexp is a string that defines a search pattern.
Such patterns can be used for match or replace operations on strings. The
control syntax uses a limited set of characters: `*{}[]()^$.|*+?-`
The implementations can vary, look at _Regular expressions in Java_, etc.

.Boolean "or"
 A vertical bar separates alternatives. apple|orange

.Grouping
 Parentheses are used to define the scope and precedence of the operators.
 For example, gray|grey and gr(a|e)y are equivalent patterns which both describe
 the set of "gray" or "grey". Grouping is also used to specify and extract
 specific data within the regex match.

.Quantification
 A quantifier how often the previous element must precede to match.

- `?` 	optional occurrence, colou?r matches both "color" and "colour", also
  used for greediness control
- `*`   zero or more occurrence; ab*c matches "ac", "abc", "abbc", "abbbc", and so on.
- `+` 	at least one occurrence; ab+c matches "abc", "abbc", "abbbc", and so on, but not "ac".
- `{n}` 	The preceding item is matched exactly `n` times.
- `{min,}` 	The preceding item is matched at least `min` times.
- `{min,max}` 	The preceding item is matched at least `min` times, but less than `max` times. 


.Wildcards

- `^` beginning of a line (also used as a negation, see below)
- `$` end of line
- `.` match any character
- `[]` determines a group of characters, `-` interval, `^` is negation
  * `[a-z]` match any character between *a* and *z*
  * `[0123456789]` or `[0-9]` match any decimal digit
  * `[^A-Z]` match all characters except all between *A* and *Z*

.Implementation
  The environment (programming language, text editor) usually defines some
  specific abbreviations or macros.

- `\d` decimal digit
- `\w`, `\W` word character, non-word character
- `\s`, `\S` space character, non-space character
- `\b`, `\<`, `\>` word boundary, beginning/end of a word

.Working with meta-characters
	Meta-characters need to be escaped if they should be matched.

Regex `\\d` matches string `\d`, regex `\*\+\+\?` matches string `*++?`

== Regex Examples

Notation: example regular expressions are enclosed between two slashes /regex/.

[source,perl]
----
/[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}/			# match a username
/[a-z0-9_-]{6,18}/			# match a password
/0x?([a-f0-9]+)/		    # match a hexadecimal number	
/(\d\d):(\d\d):(\d\d)/		# match a date in hh:mm:ss format

# match a web address
/(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?/

== Exercise

Consider a string containing multiple space separated expressions.  An
expression is either a single word or a compound expression consisting of
multiple words between double quotes.

Example input:
----
apple orange banana "honey pie" sun "high noon"
----

Example output:
----
all expressions: 6
compound expressions: 2
