== Las Vegas and Monte Carlo

- *Las Vegas* are randomized algorithms that always give the correct result but
  can be very resource-intensive.

- *Monte Carlo* is a class of randomized algorithms that use repeated sampling to
  approximate the exact solution.

/* Las Vegas algorithm */
while(true) {

    k = RandomInteger(a.length);

    if ( a[k] == 1 )
        return k;
}


/* Monte Carlo algorithm */
nr_samples = 500;

while(nr_samples > 0) {

    k = RandomInteger(a.length);

    if ( a[k] == 1 )
        return k;

    nr_samples--;
}

throw new Exception("Algorithm failed!");

n     = 1000000;
count = 0;

for ( i = 0 ; i < n ; i++ ) {

    x = RandomInteger(2) - 1;
    y = RandomInteger(2) - 1;

    if ( x * x + y * y < 1 ) {
        count++;
    }
}

print( "pi = ", 4 * count / n );

== Genetic Algorithms

- Class of evolutionary algorithms that uses techniques inspired by evolutionary
  biology such as inheritance, recombination, mutation, and selection

. The evolution starts with a population of randomly generated individuals.
The result of this step is called *generation*.

. *Fitness* of each individual is computed and evaluated. If desired fitness is
reached, the algorithm terminates.

. Regarding to their fitness, multiple individuals are selected to form a new
generation. New individuals are created using recombination and mutation.

. Go to 2


.Chromosome

- Chromosome is the basic descriptive data element of an individual, usually
  stored as vector data
  * binary number
  * array of integers, letters, etc.

- Every chromosome represents a single solution candidate for the problem.


.Fitness

- The fitness function quantifies the similarity of an individual with the optimal
  solution.


.Selection

- Arbitrary
- Ranking
- Tournament
- Roulette wheel


.Recombination, Mutation

- Recombination takes typically two chromosomes and produces a new chromosome.
  * Systematically
  * Or in any different manner

- Mutation is operation that randomly changes information of a chromosome.
  * Useful to escape from local maximum


== Example: Bit Count

Maximize the number of non-zero bits in a word (16 bit integer value).

. Generate 4 random integers (4 is the population size)
. Compute fitness for each, terminate if fitness reaches 16
. Keep the first two with best fitness for the next generation
. Drop the other two
. Create third via recombination of 1st and 2nd
. Create fourth via mutation of 1st (change one bit)
. Go to 2

== Example: The Backpack Problem

Find a subset of objects that fit into a backpack with given capacity.

Example: target capacity 1.44 MB, files in the '/bin' directory

image::img/vl10_backpack.png[]

.Chromosome
Binary string, 1 for file that's included, 0 for file that's excluded.

.Fitness Function
Sum of files that are included. Individuals with sum higher than target capacity
are not fit.
